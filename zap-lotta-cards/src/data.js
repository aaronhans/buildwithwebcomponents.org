But over the last year, Web Components have slowly lost their weirdness. Because the controversial parts of the spec were jettisoned. We're finally at the point were it's easier to add a Custom Element into any app than it is a React component. Now that's weird.",

Having this ability as part of major browsers is empowering, and eliminates the need to deliver a large JavaScript framework package to every visitor. Our web component-based widgets can be integrated into any of our websites without additional requirements no matter how that website is constructed. With web components, we limit our exposure to additional technical debt due to front-end framework churn.",

When coupled with Shadow DOM, Custom Elements should be able to work in any application. But things don't always work seamlessly. This project runs a suite of tests against each framework to identify interoperability issues, and highlight potential fixes already implemented in other frameworks. If frameworks agree on how they will communicate with Custom Elements, it makes developers' jobs easier; they can author their elements to meet these expectations.",
