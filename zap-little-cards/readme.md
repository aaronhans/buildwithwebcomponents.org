# ZapLittleCards

This is a zap web component initially generated by our yeoman generator: <a href="http://stash.aur.ziprealty.com:7990/projects/WBC/repos/generator-web-component/browse">http://stash.aur.ziprealty.com:7990/projects/WBC/repos/generator-web-component/browse</a> it includes the following

- Cypress unit test with fixture
- Standard ESLint config
- SASS file in src/_index.scss
- HTML file executed as a template literal in src/index.html You refer to variables passed into the template literal transform with the scope prefix
- Web component javascript source file in src/index.js
- Webpack config that:
  - requires our shared SASS module so you can import common parts like colors
  - compiles SASS to CSS
  - allows includes of template literals from plain html files
  - loads svg assets as inline variables with svg-inline-loader so you can import assets like: ```import icon_email from './assets/email.svg'``` then referencing that variable in your code will output the svg element.

The src file is referenced as main in the root package.json but the latest built files are published with an npm prepublish hook. This makes it easy to use this component in build systems that don't use webpack if the built file in dist/ is required. Because we are distributing the built file we have not included the common webcomponent polyfills which are already required in our sites outside of this module.

The package.json references the source code repository so users of the module know where to find the original

The webpack config does not transpile, all our sites consuming our components now are doing their own transpilation to their own browser target set so we want to allow consumers to choose a transpile target or do multiple targets if they have are delivering ES6 modules to some browsers and bigger transpiled and polyfilled builds to IE11.

## Development commands

If you are testing locally you can also run the webpack dev server via:

```
npm run start:dev
```

Which will allow you to browse your component in use at: <a href="http://localhost:3000/dev.html">http://localhost:3000/dev.html</a>

You can simultaneously run the build process via:

```
npm run build
```

The above command starts a watch process which will continue to look for file changes and rebuild so you can refresh dev.html to view changes

## Publishing

Only the `dist` folder will be available once the web component package gets installed.
